## Project Details
### Description
  Our project is aimed at providing the most appropriate features with the most appropriate technology. Notify-Around, as he name indicates, will notify its users about everything that is going around them that might want their attention. We have taken the online ad havoc and the people starting their businesses in the areas they’re not needed as an opportunity for our project and turned it into our scope.
In a world facing pandemic, it is extremely important that people keep connected with the society they’re in and welcome new people as well. This is not possible through common groups as it causes a lot of headache and unwanted ads and notifications. A user at Notify-Around is aimed to get only the notifications of his interest and those which can be easily accessible. 
Notify-Around is not a booking platform, a chat messenger or a navigator. It is an all in one community platform where the aim is to bring the people living in an area, more together. Users can share skills, attract their respective business owner nearest to them, create and follow societies & events of their interest and get the most out of their society. We are aimed at providing the people the most suitable facilities that they need at urgent basis. This will also help the new resident of the area to get closer and easily adjust in the new community. For small businesses that take a long time to settle, Notify-Around will take their business to the next level.
